**Part 1: Light Conversation Starters**

"Let‚Äôs start simple ‚Äî tell me about your day! What have you been up to today or yesterday?"

Follow with:
- "Have you ever had moments where you walked into a room and forgot why?"
- "How often do you misplace things like your phone or keys?"
- "Any funny or frustrating memory mix-ups lately?"

---

**Part 2: Memory Check-ins**

"Let‚Äôs try a little memory game! I‚Äôll say three words: **lemon**, **carpet**, **cloud**. Try to remember them ‚Äî I‚Äôll ask again later."

Then:
- "Can you name the days of the week backwards?"
- "If I gave you $5 and you bought something for $3.25, how much would you have left?"
- (Optional visual task for in-person version): ‚ÄúDraw a clock showing 9:10. How did it go?‚Äù

---

**Part 3: Daily Function and Feelings**

"Everyone forgets things sometimes ‚Äî but I‚Äôm curious how you're feeling about everyday stuff."

Ask:
- "Do you ever feel confused doing things that used to be easy, like using a microwave or sending a message?"
- "Have you needed more help recently with tasks like taking medicine or paying bills?"
- "Do you feel more down, anxious, or irritated than usual?"

---

**Part 4: Delayed Recall**

"Alright! Remember those three words from earlier? What were they again?"

---

**Part 5: Gentle Summary & Suggestions**

‚ÄúThanks for sharing with me ‚Äî you‚Äôve done great. Based on our little chat, I noticed a few things that might be worth checking with a doctor. Memory changes can happen for lots of reasons, but it‚Äôs always good to catch things early.‚Äù

If needed:
> ‚ÄúYou might want to schedule a memory screening test with a healthcare professional, just to be sure. You‚Äôre not alone, and getting help early makes a big difference.‚Äù

If all seems fine:
> ‚ÄúSounds like your memory‚Äôs holding up just fine right now ‚Äî great job! If anything changes later on, I‚Äôm here to check in anytime.‚Äù

---

**Wrap-up**

"Would you like me to check in again next month? Or remind someone you trust to follow up? Either way, you‚Äôve taken a great first step today."

### üîß Key Instructions for Implementation:

- **Tone:** Conversational, respectful, non-clinical
- **Persona:** Supportive peer ‚Äî think helpful grandchild or friendly neighbor
- **Ethics:** Clearly state it‚Äôs not a diagnosis; suggest professional help if needed
- **Adaptability:** Use branching logic to go deeper based on responses
- **Privacy:** Remind users this chat is confidential and data is not shared without consent

---

Let me know if you'd like this version adapted for seniors, caregivers, voice interfaces, or in Thai!
